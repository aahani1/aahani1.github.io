Hi, welcome to my website!

My name is Anastasia, and I am happy to have you here.

My interests lie in optimization (in uncertain environments), approximation algorithms (including online & dynamic), the intersection of theory and machine learning, and more!
I love: space exploration, ML, mathematics, coding, philosophy.

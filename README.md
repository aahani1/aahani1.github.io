Hi, welcome to my website!

My name is Anastasia, and I am happy to have you here.

Here is me in Italy earlier this summer:

My interests lie in optimization (in uncertain environments), approximation algorithms (including online & dynamic), the intersection of theory and machine learning, and more!

About me:

- I used to be a competitive kickboxer (specifically a form of chinese fighting called Sanshou)
- I am an oil painter! See [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c7b5896-adf8-49c7-b547-5f167f13f7de)

- 
I love: space exploration, ML, mathematics, coding, philosophy.
